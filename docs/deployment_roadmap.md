# Hapa Transcribe: Deployment Roadmap

This document outlines the phased approach for developing and deploying Hapa Transcribe, including timelines, milestones, and integration points with the broader Hapa ecosystem.

## Overview

Hapa Transcribe will be developed in three distinct phases, starting with a standalone MVP and progressing to full integration with Hapa's decentralized ecosystem. This approach allows for rapid initial deployment while ensuring proper integration with Hapa's complex architecture.

   - Simple, functional interface

2. **Ephemeral Token Server**
   - Node.js backend service
   - Secure OpenAI API key handling
   - Basic authentication mechanism
   - Token generation endpoint

3. **WebRTC Integration**
   - Audio capture from microphone
   - WebRTC connection to OpenAI
   - Basic error handling
   - Real-time transcript display

### Development Tasks

| Task | Description | Duration | Dependencies |
|------|-------------|----------|--------------|
| Frontend scaffolding | Set up React project, routing, basic component structure | 2 days | None |
| Backend setup | Create Node.js server with Express, configure middleware | 1 day | None |
| API integration | Implement OpenAI Realtime API client, token handling | 3 days | Backend setup |
| WebRTC implementation | Audio capture, peer connection, data channel | 3 days | API integration |

### Success Criteria
- Successful transcription of microphone audio in real-time
- <500ms latency from speech to displayed text
- Proper handling of API authentication
- Basic error recovery for common issues

## Phase 2: Hapa Integration

**Timeline: 1 week + 2 days after MVP**

### Objectives
- Embed application in Hapa Electron app
- Integrate with Hapa's DID authentication
- Add Hyperdrive storage support
- Enhance UI to match Hapa's design language

### Deliverables

1. **Electron Integration**
   - Embed as `<webview>` in Hapa
   - IPC communication with Hapa
   - Responsive design for embedded context
   - Dark/light mode compatibility

2. **DID Authentication**
   - Integration with Hapa's authentication system
   - Secure handling of DID credentials
   - Permission management for transcripts
   - User-specific settings

3. **Hyperdrive Storage**
   - Save transcripts to Hyperdrive
   - End-to-end encryption of stored transcripts
   - Access control based on DID
   - Export/import functionality

### Development Tasks

| Task | Description | Duration | Dependencies |
|------|-------------|----------|--------------|
| Electron packaging | Configure app for Electron embedding | 1 day | MVP completion |
| DID integration | Implement DID auth adapter and validation | 2 days | Electron packaging |
| Hyperdrive connector | Create storage adapter for Hyperdrive | 2 days | DID integration |
